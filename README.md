# AMITransfer
Ever dreamed to make data out of an closed remote/virtual desktop ?
This application will pixel them out for you.

This application comes in two parts.
AMIinOneFile.java and AMIout.jar.

Use https://sourceforge.net/projects/amirewriter/
to make AMIin goes into your remote desktop.

Run AMIin using java, and select a file to transfer outside of your remote desktop.

At the same time, run AMIout on your local computer.
AMIin and AMIout will communicate, using pixels.

At the end AMIout will re-create the file on your local computer.

AMITransfer is design to easily and with fun, transfer out data from a remote/virtual closed (blocking copy/clipboard and such) environment to your open local computer.
