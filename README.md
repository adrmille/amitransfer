# AMITransfert
Ever dream to make data out of an closed remote/virtual desktop ?
This application will pixel them out for you.

This application comes in two parts.
AMIin.java and AMIout.jar.

Use https://sourceforge.net/projects/amirewriter/
to make AMIin goes into your remote desktop.

Run AMIin using java, and select a file to transfert outside of your remote desktop.

At the same time, run AMIout on your local computer.
AMIin and AMIout will communicate, using pixels.

At the end AMIout will re-create the file on your local computer.

AMITransfert is design to easly and with fun, transfert out datas from a remote/virtual closed (blocking copy/clipboard and such) environnement to your open local computer.
